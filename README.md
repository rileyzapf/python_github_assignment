Monthly Pay Calculator 

This progra asks the user for their weekly hours as well as their pay and then calculates how much they make per month. It can be used to find how much you need to work to reach a monthly pay or what your hourly wage needs to be. It can be adjusted for more technical uses and for other alternatives.

You can run it using:
python3 app.py

Here is an example of how it works:
